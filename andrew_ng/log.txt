No data augmentation - very good results!

With data augmentation, [10, 1], gen loss is mae - bad.
Somehow stupid patchy errors in the generated images.
Wish to change the weight between reconstruction loss and discriminator loss, and also put mouth-weighted reconstruction loss to the generator, rather than just MAE (currently this is done only when the DCGAN is compiled)
Current weights of reconstruction loss and binary cross-entropy - [10, 1]

With data augmentation, [1, 1], gen loss is mae
Weights of reconstruction loss and binary cross-entropy - [1, 1] (previously [10, 1])
Didn't work at all.. Became blurry also!
Changed back to [10, 1]
Changed gen compilation loss to mouth-weighted l1 instead of mae

With data augmentation, [10, 1], gen loss is l1-weighted
Trying with l1_weighted_loss around the mouth, with data augmentation..
Patchy errors but better than 1..

Tried on small dataset with l1_weighted_loss around the mouth for gen - patchy errors!
