No data augmentation - very good results!

With data augmentation - bad.
Somehow stupid patchy errors in the generated images.
Wish to change the weight between reconstruction loss and discriminator loss, and also put mouth-weighted reconstruction loss to the generator, rather than just MAE (currently this is done only when the DCGAN is compiled)
Current weights of reconstruction loss and binary cross-entropy - [10, 1]
